<h3>At 89 years old, Agnès Varda just became the oldest person to ever be nominated for an Oscar for her documentary film “Visages Villages.” But to Varda, the nomination is just one tiny accomplishment of her 60 year long career. Varda is a French film director whose fictional and documentary films employ an experimental, lyrical style to convey strong political messages as well as nuanced portrayals of women’s emotions and lives. She was the only woman director of the French New Wave, a French film movement during the 1960s that is too often only remembered as being dominated by filmmakers like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. Varda’s documentary-fiction film “La Pointe Courte” is actually regarded as the first New Wave film. Her 1962 film “Cléo from 5 to 7” follows a singer named Cléo from 5 pm to 7 pm in real time as she waits for the results of a cancer test. The film discusses feminist themes like how the way in which women are perceived affects how they see themselves and existentialist themes like mortality and what it means to live a good life. It also includes a subtle yet strong critique of France’s colonialism in Algeria.
